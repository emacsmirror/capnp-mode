// KJ_TRY / KJ_CATCH macros
//
// Convenient macros for exception handling that automatically coerce all catchable exceptions to
// kj::Exception. These can replace both raw `try {} catch(...) { getCaughtExceptionAsKj() }` and
// `runCatchingExceptions()` usage.
//
//   KJ_TRY {
//     // code that may throw
//   } KJ_CATCH(e) {
//     // code that handles the exception `e`
//     kj::throwFatalException(kj::mv(e));  // Optional: rethrow like so
//   }
//
// KJ_TRY: Semantically equivalent to `try`. The user-provided code block following this macro
// literally is a `try` block.
//
// KJ_CATCH(name): The parameter is a user-chosen name. `name` will be a `kj::Exception&` in the
// catch handler's code block. If you want to catch an exception but don't need the exception
// details, you can name the exception `_` to suppress the unused variable warning, or suffix it
// with `[[maybe_unused]]`. You are free to move the exception away, if you want, e.g. to rethrow
// it. As a reminder, if you want to rethrow the exception, you must use
// `kj::throwFatalException()`, and not a naked `throw`, to ensure the exception's attached stack
// trace is accurate.
//
// The user-provided code block following `KJ_CATCH(e)` IS NOT A TRUE CATCH HANDLER! In particular,
// this means:
// - YOU CANNOT RETHROW the current exception with `throw`, because there is none.
// - You can jump into the "catch handler" blocks with `goto`, but that would be inadvisable.
// - It doesn't have to be a braced block -- it can be just a semi-colon, like `KJ_CATCH(_);`.
//
// Advantages over raw try/catch:
// - Automatically coerces all exceptions (including std::exceptions) to kj::Exception -- no need to
//   `catch (...)` and call `kj::getCaughtExceptionAsKj()`.
// - You can `co_await` inside the catch handlers!
//
// Advantages over runCatchingExceptions():
// - No need for lambda wrapping: The potentially-throwy code block runs inline with the function
//   body, meaning you can `co_await` in it if you're in a coroutine, `return` from the enclosing
//   function, `break` an outer loop, etc.
//
// TODO(soon): Does KJ_CATCH need to do anything to adjust stack traces in the caught exceptions?
//
// MIGRATION GUIDE:
//
// Raw `try/catch(...)` blocks which immediately call `getCaughtExceptionAsKj()` can be mechanically
// converted to `KJ_TRY / KJ_CATCH(e)` without putting any thought into the matter. This is because
// `KJ_TRY / KJ_CATCH` is simply syntax sugar for immediately calling `getCaughtexceptionAsKj()` in
// the catch handler. That is, the following are completely equivalent:
//
//   try {
//     // code that may throw
//   } catch (...) {
//     auto e = kj::getCaughtexceptionAsKj();  // first line of catch handler
//     // code that handles the exception `e`
//   }
//
//   KJ_TRY {
//     // code that may throw
//   } KJ_CATCH(e) {
//     // code that handles the exception `e`
//   }
//
// Raw `try/catch(...)` blocks which DO NOT call, or do not immediately call,
// `getCaughtExceptionAsKj()`, require a bit more thought. This is because such blocks will catch
// KJ's special "uncatchable" exceptions, such as `CanceledException`, which are used to implement
// features such as fiber cancellation. This means that any code in a `catch(...)` block which
// appears before `getCaughtExceptionAsKj()` (if it appears at all) will run during fiber
// cancellation. If such blocks do not ultimately rethrow their exception with a naked `throw`
// statement, then they are almost certainly buggy, and will suppress fiber cancellation and similar
// features. They should probably be converted to `KJ_TRY / KJ_CATCH`.
//
//   try {
//     // code that may throw
//   } catch (...) {
//     // squelch all exceptions -- PROBABLY BUGGY, tread carefully
//   }
//
// For raw `try/catch(...)` blocks which do not call `getCaughtExceptionAsKj()`, but DO rethrow
// their exception  with a naked `throw`, it may be best to leave them alone, unless you know for
// sure the code block should not run during events like fiber cancellation. That said, there is
// also an alternative KJ utility you could convert them to: `KJ_ON_SCOPE_FAILURE`. That is, the
// following are equivalent:
//
//   try {
//     // code that may throw
//   } catch (...) {
//     // unconditional cleanup code
//     throw;
//   }
//
//   {
//     KJ_ON_SCOPE_FAILURE(/* unconditional cleanup code */);
//     // code that may throw
//   }
//
// `KJ_ON_SCOPE_FAILURE` has slightly more overhead than `try/catch` (it saves the current exception
// count on construction), and wraps your code block in a macro, so it is most appropriate in
// non-hot path code with one-liner cleanup actions.
//
// Some raw `try/catch(...)` blocks store their caught exception in a Maybe in order to later
// `KJ_IF_SOME` the Maybe to `co_await` some asynchronous operation outside the `catch` block. These
// may either be mechanically converted as-is, or refactored to move the `co_await` operation
// directly into the `KJ_CATCH` block, eliminating the need for the Maybe. That is, the following
// are equivalent:
//
//   Maybe<Exception> maybeException;
//   try {
//     // code that may throw
//   } catch (...) {
//     maybeException = kj::getCaughtexceptionAsKj();
//   }
//   KJ_IF_SOME(e, maybeException) {
//     co_await asyncExceptionHandler(kj::mv(e));
//   }
//
//   KJ_TRY {
//     // code that may throw
//   } KJ_CATCH(e) {
//     co_await asyncExceptionHandler(kj::mv(e));
//   }
//
// Lastly, there is `kj::runCatchingExceptions(func)`. `runCatchingExceptions()` calls
// `getCaughtExceptionAsKj()` under the hood, so there are no concerns about inadvertently catching
// uncatchable exceptions. Instead, the main concerns are changes in semantics due to no longer
// moving function objects around, or due to inlining the function object's body into the calling
// function. An example of the former:
//
//   KJ_IF_SOME(e, runCatchingExceptions(kj::mv(func))) {
//     // code that handles the exception `e`
//   }
//
//   KJ_TRY {
//     func();  // SUBTLE: No longer moves `func`!
//   } KJ_CATCH(e) {
//     // code that handles the exception `e`
//   }
//
// A contrived example of a change in semantics due to inlining the function body:
//
//   KJ_IF_SOME(e, runCatchingExceptions([&]() {
//     // code that may throw
//     auto val = KJ_UNWRAP_OR_RETURN(maybeVal);
//     // more code that may throw
//   })) {
//     // code that handles the exception `e`
//   }
//
//   KJ_TRY {
//     // code that may throw
//     // SUBTLE: Cannot use KJ_UNWRAP_OR_RETURN anymore.
//     KJ_IF_SOME(val, maybeVal) {
//       // more code that may throw
//     }
//   } KJ_CATCH(e) {
//     // code that handles the exception `e`
//   }
//
// Since a common `runCatchingExceptions()` pattern is to immediately `KJ_IF_SOME` its result,
// you may rarely encounter the following odd syntax:
//
//   KJ_IF_SOME(e, runCatchingExceptions(kj::mv(func))) {
//     // Block A: code that handles the exception `e`
//   } else {
//     // Block B: un-"tried" code that runs only on success
//   }
//   // Block C: code that runs on success or exception handling, if they did not throw
//
// Such patterns could be expressed by setting a `failed` boolean in the `KJ_CATCH` handler, and
// running Block B iff `!failed` after the `KJ_TRY / `KJ_CATCH`, or we could add a new
// `KJ_IF_CATCH(e)` macro that supports a trailing `else` clause. That said, such patterns are
// probably ill-advised to begin with.

// If the platform doesn't support stack traces, returns an empty array.
//
// `ignoreCount` items will be truncated from the front of the trace. This is useful for chopping
// off a prefix of the trace that is uninteresting to the developer because it's just locations
// inside the debug infrastructure that is requesting the trace. Be careful to mark functions as
// KJ_NOINLINE if you intend to count them in `ignoreCount`. Note that, unfortunately, the
// ignored entries will still waste space in the `space` array (and the returned array's `begin()`
// is never exactly equal to `space.begin()` due to this effect, even if `ignoreCount` is zero
// since `getStackTrace()` needs to ignore its own internal frames).

  // This is meant for debugging purposes, and the results are best-effort. The C++ standard
  // library does not provide any way to inspect uncaught exceptions, so this class can only
  // discover KJ exceptions thrown using throwFatalException() or throwRecoverableException().
  // All KJ code uses those two functions to throw exceptions, but if your own code uses a bare
  // `throw`, or if the standard library throws an exception, these cannot be inspected.
  //
  // This class is safe to use in a signal handler.

// file, line, and description provided. In the latter case, `traceSeparator` is appended to the

// original stack trace and any new trace frames added later.
